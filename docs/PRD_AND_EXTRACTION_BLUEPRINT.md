## 🎯 1. Executive Summary & Product Vision

### The Problem:
Every year, freelancers, solopreneurs, and digital agencies lose billions of dollars to **unpaid invoices, overdue milestones, and ghosting clients**. 
* Freelancers hate calling clients to demand overdue money — it's awkward, uncomfortable, and damages relationships.
* Traditional debt collection agencies charge 30–50% contingency fees and use aggressive, legally risky harassment.
* Email reminders get ignored, flagged as spam, or left unread.

### The Solution:
**RevClaim AI is an autonomous, empathetic, and compliant AI Voice Calling Agent that recovers overdue B2B invoices.**
1. **1-Click Call Dispatch:** A freelancer uploads or connects their overdue invoice (Client Name, Phone, Due Date, Amount).
2. **Empathetic Voice Negotiation:** The AI agent autonomously dials the client's phone via **Twilio + ElevenLabs Conversational AI**. It verifies the debtor's identity, politely explains the overdue balance with exact numbers, handles hardship or disputes with calibrated tone, and secures a **Promise-to-Pay (PTP)**.
3. **Instant Dodo Payments Link:** The moment the client commits to pay (in full or installment), **viaSocket MCP** triggers an instant SMS and WhatsApp message with a live **Dodo Payments checkout link**.
4. **Automated Settlement & Monetization:** Once the client pays via Dodo Payments, the freelancer gets their money back in real time. **RevClaim AI collects a small success fee (₹199 / $5) via Dodo Payments.**

## ⚡ 5. Step-by-Step Clean Migration Plan (Zero Accidents)

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Scaffolding (In Progress)**
   - Lock PRD & Extraction Blueprint (`PRD_AND_EXTRACTION_BLUEPRINT.md`).
   - Initialize clean root `package.json` with Next.js 15, Tailwind, `@dodopayments/nextjs`, and `lucide-react`.
2. **Phase 2: Code Extraction & Adaptation**
   - Copy and clean `elevenlabs.ts` and `/api/call` from `haggle/`.
   - Adapt `CFLO-Agent` negotiation prompts from banking EMI to B2B invoices.
   - Embed `dodo/` checkout and webhook handlers.
3. **Phase 3: Cockpit UI & Demo-Mode Fallback**
   - Build the high-contrast operator cockpit (inspired by `DispatcherAI`).
   - Implement the `demo-call.ts` simulation mode so judges can evaluate 100% of the functionality without dialing real numbers.
4. **Phase 4: viaSocket MCP & Dodo Integration Verification**
   - Wire MCP webhook for WhatsApp/SMS link dispatch.
   - Test Dodo Payments checkout generation in test mode.
5. **Phase 5: Safe Cleanup of Cloned Repos**
   - Move reference repos into a clean `.archive/` or delete unneeded files only *after* verified extraction.
